				<p class="discription">Wolf packs are established according to a strict hierarchy,
					with a dominant alpha male at the top and an alpha female not far behind.
					Usually this male and female are the only animals of the pack to breed.
					Packs consist of between five and ten animals – usually offspring from several years.
					All of a pack’s adults help to care for young pups
					By bringing them food and watching them while others hunt.</p>
